### Hurricanes
This Shiny App uses the [hurdat2](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-format-atlantic.pdf) database to show hurricanes from the year 1955. You can see more on the National Hurricane Center on their [main page](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/).

#### Visuals
Besides geolocalization of the data, there are three main visual cues:
* Different **color** means different hurricanes (by name).
* Less **transparent** circle means newer data point.
* The **size** of the circle is proportional to wind speed.

#### Interactivity
With this app you can:
* Select the year using the **slider**
* Highlight a particular Hurricane by name using the **Dropdown menu**
* Click on a circle to reveal: 
	* **Name**, 
	* **Date** (*yyyymmdd*), 
	* **Hour** (*hhmm*).

Finally, you can **drag this panel** if it's in the way.
